In November 2018 Dan Wainwright [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-46153887) on the one million crimes of fly-tipping reported by councils across England during 2017-18, the first fall in five years.

There is no estimated cost of tackling fly-tipping this year as Defra has decided it is an outdated measure.

A spokeswoman told us it was “because the standard unit costs that these estimates were based on are now more than ten years out of date and we do not have confidence in the continued relevance of these”.

We found the areas with the highest rates of fly-tipping by population, combining Defra statistics with ONS population estimates.

Visuals were made either in R using ggplot2 or within the BBC’s in house “in-depth toolkit”.
